			<h3>What is an allergic reaction?</h3>
				<p>An allergy is not the same as an intolerance. Food allergies can be fatal, and should not be confused with a food intolerance, which is uncomforatble, but not fatal.</p>
				<p>An allergic reaction occurs when the immune system overreacts and becomes irritated at something in the environment that doesn't affect most people. When the immune system views a cell as a threat, it releases Immunoglobulin E, or IgE, to connect with the mast cells to protect them. When these allergens are ingested again, they stick to the IgE cells, which release histamine to protect you, which, in turn, causes allergic reactions.</p>

			<h3>What is a meat allergy?</h3>
				<p>Meat allergies can be caused by all kinds of meat: beef, lamb, pork, goat, and even whale and seal. As well as this, some types of poultry can cause allergic reactions. While one of the more uncommon allergies, it is slightly more severe than some of the others.</p>
				<p>Meat allergies are not always developed at birth. In some cases, if you are allergic to one type of meat, other allergies may develop from that, including other meats and poultry. Some children that are allergic to milk might also be allergic to beef by proxy.
			<h4>The Lone Star Tick</h4>
				<p>The Lone Star Tick is a tick whose bite releases alpha-gal into the victim's system, which triggers a reaction after a few hours, forcing the victim to develop a reaction to red meat- all with a single bite.

			<h3>Symptoms</h3>
				<p>Meat allergies can have many negative symptoms on their victims. If more than one of these persists, contact your student's parent or doctor. Symptoms vary from person to person, and you may not experience the same reaction twice.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Hives or skin rash</li>
					<li>Nausea</li>
					<li>Stomach cramps</li>
					<li>Indigestion</li>
					<li>Vomiting</li>
					<li>Diarrhea</li>
					<li>Stuffy/Runny nose</li>
					<li>Sneezing</li>
					<li>Headaches</li>
					<li>Asthma</li>
					<li>Anaphylaxis</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<h3>Treatment</h3>
				<p>If you suspect one of your students may have an allergy of some kind, contact their parents or doctor and inform them. They will help you manage it. Be sure to get the following information from your student to be better prepared:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>What and how much they ate</li>
						<li>How long it took for the symptoms to show</li>
						<li>What the symptoms were and how long they lasted</li>
					</ul>
				<p>Make sure to keep your students away from any foods that can trigger their symptoms. If your students come to school with antihistamines or corticosteroids, be sure to understand how they work. In extreme circumstances, epinephrine can help reverse reactions. <a href="epipen.html">Click here</a> to read our demonstration on how to use an epinephrine injector. If one of your students is prescribed an auto-injector, be sure you know how to use that as well. Epinephrine should be administered as soon as possible, and emergency services should be contacted straight away. Be sure to inform them that epniehprine was administered and more may be required.</p> 
				<p>As a teacher, you should always have a written plan from a doctor or parent detailing any and all allergies your students have.</p>
