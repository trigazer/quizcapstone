			<h3>What is an allergic reaction?</h3>
				<p>An allergy is not the same as an intolerance. Food allergies can be fatal, and should not be confused with a food intolerance, which is uncomforatble, but not fatal.</p>
				<p>An allergic reaction occurs when the immune system overreacts and becomes irritated at something in the environment that doesn't affect most people. When the immune system views a cell as a threat, it releases Immunoglobulin E, or IgE, to connect with the mast cells to protect them. When these allergens are ingested again, they stick to the IgE cells, which release histamine to protect you, which, in turn, causes allergic reactions.</p>

			<h3>What is a gluten allergy?</h3>
				<p>Gluten intolerances prevent people from eating grains such as wheat, barley, and rye. Gluten allergies come in two forms: celiac and nonceliac. Celiac diseases are more severe diseases that include gluten allergies, and can cause the intestines to become inflamed and damaged when consuming gluten. Inflamed intestines absorb nutrients less effectively, leading to other malnourishment problems. However, not every gluten intolerance is celiac disease. Nonceliac intolerances are far less severe, and don't cause damage to the intestines.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, doctors do not have an accepted standard or test for finding gluten allergies. It is usually down to the individual to be completely honest when informing doctors of their conditions and anything they experience when consuming gluten products.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="rs">
			<h3>Symptoms</h3>
				<p>Gluten allergies can have many negative symptoms on their victims. If more than one of these persists, contact your student's parent or doctor. Symptoms vary from person to person, and you may not experience the same reaction twice.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Nausea/Vomiting</li>
					<li>Diarrhea</li>
					<li>Upset Stomach</li>
					<li>Abdominal Pain</li>
					<li>Bloating</li>
					<li>Bone and Joint Pain</li>
					<li>Weakness or Fatigue</li>
					<li>Persistent Hunger</li>
					<li>Irritability</li>
					<li>Malnourishment</li>
					<li>Panic Attacks</li>
					<li>Vertigo</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div id="st">
			<h3>Treatment</h3>
				<p>If you suspect one of your students may have an allergy of some kind, contact their parents or doctor and inform them. They will help you manage it. Be sure to get the following information from your student to be better prepared:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>What and how much they ate</li>
						<li>How long it took for the symptoms to show</li>
						<li>What the symptoms were and how long they lasted</li>
					</ul>
				<p>Make sure to keep your students away from any foods that can trigger their symptoms. If your students come to school with antihistamines or corticosteroids, be sure to understand how they work. In extreme circumstances, epinephrine can help reverse reactions. <a href="epipen.html">Click here</a> to read our demonstration on how to use an epinephrine injector. If one of your students is prescribed an auto-injector, be sure you know how to use that as well. Epinephrine should be administered as soon as possible, and emergency services should be contacted straight away. Be sure to inform them that epniehprine was administered and more may be required.</p> 
				<p>As a teacher, you should always have a written plan from a doctor or parent detailing any and all allergies your students have.</p>

			<h3>What is a soy allergy?</h3>
				<p>Many people allergic to soy ask if they should also avoid peanuts, and vice versa, as both belong to the legume family. The two foods have their own allergen triggers, and may or may not be consumed safely by an individual with the opposite allergy.</p>
				<p>As a member of the legume family, soy is a common ingreident of infant formula and other processed foods. In children, soy is one of the most common food allergens. Typically, the reactions first occur in children under 3, and are outgrown by the age of 10.</p>
				<p>Soy or soy products can be found in some infant formulas, canned broths, soups, canned tuna, processed meats, hot dogs, energy bars, baked goods, and many other processed foods.</p>
				<p>Most people allergic to soy can safely consume highly refined soybean oil. Be careful when consuming any foods that have been fried in any type of oil, due to cross-contamination: if a soy-containing food is fried in oil, the oil absorbs the soy proteins.</p>
