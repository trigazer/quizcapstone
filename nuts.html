			<h3>What is an allergic reaction?</h3>
				<p>An allergy is not the same as an intolerance. Food allergies can be fatal, and should not be confused with a food intolerance, which is uncomforatble, but not fatal.</p>
				<p>An allergic reaction occurs when the immune system overreacts and becomes irritated at something in the environment that doesn't affect most people. When the immune system views a cell as a threat, it releases Immunoglobulin E, or IgE, to connect with the mast cells to protect them. When these allergens are ingested again, they stick to the IgE cells, which release histamine to protect you, which, in turn, causes allergic reactions.</p>

			<h3>What is a peanut allergy?</h3>
				<p>Peanuts are one of the few allergens closely associated with anaphylaxis. Students with peanut allergies are some of the most likely to have life-threatening reactions. Unfortunately, peanut allergies are also one of the most common allergies, especially amongst kids and teens, whereas about 20% of adults eventually outgrow it. In May 2010, a study reported that the amount of peanut allergy cases more than tripld between 1997 and 2008. To combat this, many schools are becoming "nut free". Generally, this means peanuts are not sold (or sometimes even allowed) on campus.</p>
				<p>Peanuts and peanut products are usually found in the unlikeliest of places.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Candies, cereals, and baked goods (such as cake and pie) often contain traces of peanut.</li>
						<li>Both Mexican and Asian cuisine rely heavily on peanuts.</li>
						<li>Ice cream parlours might be dangerous, as peanuts are a common topping.</li>
						<li>Even foods that don't contain peanuts may be contaiminated during production or perparation.</li>
					</ul>
				<p>Contrary to popular belief, peanut and treenut allergies are not the same. Peanuts are legumes, not tree nuts, meaning they belong in the same family as soybeans, peas, and lentils. Highly refined peanut oil can usually be tolerated by those with peanut allergies, since it is purified, refined, bleached, and deodorized, to remove all traces of peanut protein.</p>

			<h3>Symptoms</h3>
				<p>Peanut allergies can have many negative symptoms on their victims. If more than one of these persists, contact your student's parent or doctor. Symptoms vary from person to person, and you may not experience the same reaction twice.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Itchy skin or hives, either as small spots or large welts</li>
					<li>Itching or tingling in the mouth or throat</li>
					<li>Nausea</li>
					<li>A runny or congested nose</li>
					<li>Anaphylaxis</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div id="st">
			<h3>Treatment</h3>
				<p>If you suspect one of your students may have an allergy of some kind, contact their parents or doctor and inform them. They will help you manage it. Be sure to get the following information from your student to be better prepared:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>What and how much they ate</li>
						<li>How long it took for the symptoms to show</li>
						<li>What the symptoms were and how long they lasted</li>
					</ul>
				<p>Make sure to keep your students away from any foods that can trigger their symptoms. If your students come to school with antihistamines or corticosteroids, be sure to understand how they work. In extreme circumstances, epinephrine can help reverse reactions. <a href="epipen.html">Click here</a> to read our demonstration on how to use an epinephrine injector. If one of your students is prescribed an auto-injector, be sure you know how to use that as well. Epinephrine should be administered as soon as possible, and emergency services should be contacted straight away. Be sure to inform them that epniehprine was administered and more may be required.</p> 
				<p>As a teacher, you should always have a written plan from a doctor or parent detailing any and all allergies your students have.</p>

			<h3>What is a tree nut allergy?</h3>
				<p>It is important to note that peanuts are <b>NOT</b> tree nuts, and are not in this section. Visit our peanut page for peanut allergies. This being said, about a third of all people allergic to peanuts also react to at least one tree nut. Tree nuts, as well as peanuts, are one of the few allergens commonly linked to anaphylaxis, with shellfish coming in closely behind.</p>
				<p>Some tree nut allergies may permit other tree nuts to be consumed. Despite this, it is recommended to avoid all nuts due to cross-contamination. In 2010, a study showed that peanut allergies in children have been rising steadily.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>in 1997, 0.6% of households had a child with a peanut allergy</li>
						<li>in 2002, 1.2%</li>
						<li>in 2008, 2.1%</li>
					</ul>
				<p>Contrary to popular belief, tree nuts allergies <b>DO</b> permit the victims to eat coconut and nutmeg. Coconut is not a botanical nut, therefore doesn't need to be avoided. The confusion with coconuts comes from the Food and Drug Administration. While technically a fruit, the FDA classifies it as a nut. Nutmeg is a spice, not a nut, and can be consumed safely.</p>
				<p>Tree nut oils and butters trigger reactions to tree nut allergies. Lotions and soaps may contain tree nut oils. Often times, tree nuts are used in recipies, as salad garnish, asian cuisine, and ice cream toppings. Less common sources are bread, breading mixes, desserts, baked goods, and sauces. It is important to read all labels carefully, as some manufacturing plants don't label non-nut products that were made in a factory that makes nuts.</p>
