			<h3>What is an allergic reaction?</h3>
				<p>An allergy is not the same as an intolerance. Food allergies can be fatal, and should not be confused with a food intolerance, which is uncomforatble, but not fatal.</p>
				<p>An allergic reaction occurs when the immune system overreacts and becomes irritated at something in the environment that doesn't affect most people. When the immune system views a cell as a threat, it releases Immunoglobulin E, or IgE, to connect with the mast cells to protect them. When these allergens are ingested again, they stick to the IgE cells, which release histamine to protect you, which, in turn, causes allergic reactions.</p>

			<h3>What is a seafood allergy?</h3>
				<p>Unlike with other allergies, most fish allergies will not appear until adulthood. Up to 40% of people reporting fish allergies had no problem as children. However, that does leave some fish allergies that surface at birth, so constant dilligence is necessary. Many prepared foods contain some kind of fish. Many common foods, including worcestershire sauce and caesar salad, contain fish of some description. Allergies to fish protein are the most common, but fish gelatin (made from skin and bones) allergies are also possible.</p>
				<p>Fish allergies and shellfish allergies may not always be mutually exclusive. For example, some people may not be able to eat finned fish (tuna or halibut) but may be able to eat lobsters and crayfish without problem. However, most doctors recommend avoiding all fish if you are allergic to one type, but this may not always be necessary.</p>

			<h3>Symptoms</h3>
				<p>Seafood allergies can have many negative symptoms on their victims. If more than one of these persists, contact your student's parent or doctor. Symptoms vary from person to person, and you may not experience the same reaction twice.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Hives or skin rash</li>
					<li>Nausea</li>
					<li>Stomach Cramps</li>
					<li>Indigestion</li>
					<li>Vomiting</li>
					<li>Diarrhea</li>
					<li>Stuffy/runny nose</li>
					<li>Sneezing</li>
					<li>Asthma</li>
					<li>Anaphylaxis</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div id="st">
			<h3>Treatment</h3>
				<p>If you suspect one of your students may have an allergy of some kind, contact their parents or doctor and inform them. They will help you manage it. Be sure to get the following information from your student to be better prepared:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>What and how much they ate</li>
						<li>How long it took for the symptoms to show</li>
						<li>What the symptoms were and how long they lasted</li>
					</ul>
				<p>Make sure to keep your students away from any foods that can trigger their symptoms. If your students come to school with antihistamines or corticosteroids, be sure to understand how they work. In extreme circumstances, epinephrine can help reverse reactions. <a href="epipen.html">Click here</a> to read our demonstration on how to use an epinephrine injector. If one of your students is prescribed an auto-injector, be sure you know how to use that as well. Epinephrine should be administered as soon as possible, and emergency services should be contacted straight away. Be sure to inform them that epniehprine was administered and more may be required.</p> 
				<p>As a teacher, you should always have a written plan from a doctor or parent detailing any and all allergies your students have.</p>

			<h3>What is a shellfish allergy?</h3>
				<p>Shellfish allergies are one of the most common and most dangerous around. More shellfish-related allergic reactions put people in the hospital than any other allergen. Crustaceans (shrimp, lobster, crab, and prawn) cause the most amount of reactions of any shellfish. In opposition, many shellfish-allergic people can tolerate mollusks (scallops, oysters, clams, and mussels).</p>
				<p>Cross contamination is rare, but still possible, as various shellfish are sometimes stored together. A person may not have to eat shellfish to react to it, as merely eating a food that has been in contact with shellfish or breathing fumes are enough to cause a reaction. Shellfish particles may carry on the air, so walking into a kitchen or eating food touched by the proteins can cause a reaction. Thankfully, shellfish is rarely a "hidden" ingredient. Even the smallest amount is required to be labeled. It should be noted that this is true of shellfish, not mollusks.</p>
				<p>Shellfish allergies and fish allergies may not be mutually exclusive. For example, some people may not be able to eat crustaceans (such as crabs or crayfish) but may be able to eat fish just fine. Along with peanuts and tree nuts, shellfish is commonly linked to anaphylaxis.</p>
