			<h3>What is an allergic reaction?</h3>
				<p>An allergy is not the same as an intolerance. Food allergies can be fatal, and should not be confused with a food intolerance, which is uncomforatble, but not fatal.</p>
				<p>An allergic reaction occurs when the immune system overreacts and becomes irritated at something in the environment that doesn't affect most people. When the immune system views a cell as a threat, it releases Immunoglobulin E, or IgE, to connect with the mast cells to protect them. When these allergens are ingested again, they stick to the IgE cells, which release histamine to protect you, which, in turn, causes allergic reactions.</p>

			<h3>What is an egg allergy?</h3>
				<p>Studies show that as many as 2 percent of all children are allergic to eggs. Fortunately, the same studies show that about 70 percent of children with an egg allergy will outgrow the condition by age 16.</p>
				<p>Eggs are one of the most common food allergens. People with an allergy to chicken eggs may also be allergic to other types of eggs, such as goose, duck, turkey, or quail.</p>
				<p>Eggs are a hidden ingredient in many foods, including canned soups, salad dressings, ice cream, and even some meat-based dishes, such as meatballs and meatloaf. Even some commercial egg substitutes contain egg protein. People with an egg allergy can sometimes tolerate baked goods and other foods containing eggs if they have been heated for a long time at a high temperature.</p>
			</div>
			<div id ="rs">
			<h3>Symptoms</h3>
				<p>Egg allergies can have many negative symptoms on their victims. If more than one of these persists, contact your student's parent or doctor. Symptoms vary from person to person, and you may not experience the same reaction twice.</p>

			<h3>Treatment</h3>
				<p>If you suspect one of your students may have an allergy of some kind, contact their parents or doctor and inform them. They will help you manage it. Be sure to get the following information from your student to be better prepared:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>What and how much they ate</li>
						<li>How long it took for the symptoms to show</li>
						<li>What the symptoms were and how long they lasted</li>
					</ul>
				<p>Make sure to keep your students away from any foods that can trigger their symptoms. If your students come to school with antihistamines or corticosteroids, be sure to understand how they work. In extreme circumstances, epinephrine can help reverse reactions. <a href="epipen.html">Click here</a> to read our demonstration on how to use an epinephrine injector. If one of your students is prescribed an auto-injector, be sure you know how to use that as well. Epinephrine should be administered as soon as possible, and emergency services should be contacted straight away. Be sure to inform them that epniehprine was administered and more may be required.</p> 
				<p>As a teacher, you should always have a written plan from a doctor or parent detailing any and all allergies your students have.</p>

			<h3>What is a dairy allergy?</h3>
				<p>Between 2 and 3 percent of children younger than 3 are allergic to milk. About 20 percent while outgrow the allergy by the age of 4, and 80 percent will outgrow it by age 16. Milk allergies are one of the more common food allergens. People allergic to cow's milk may also be allergic to other milks, such as goat and sheep.</p>
				<p>Milk contains two main proteins- casein and whey. These proteins can be found in many foods, including all dairy products, canned tuna, sausage, meats, and others. Beverage mixes and energy drinks commonly contain whey.
